# Brew Test Bot For Core Contributors

If a build has run and passed on `brew test-bot` then it can be used to quickly bottle formulae.

## Bottling

If a pull request is correct and doesn't need any modifications to commit messages or otherwise:

1. Review and approve the pull request. Be sure to thank the contributor!
2. Wait for BrewTestBot to automatically merge the pull request. This happens about once an hour. BrewTestBot will comment if there is a failure.

If a pull request won't be automatically merged by Brew Test Bot (has the labels `do not merge`, `new formula`, or `automerge-skip`), but the [commit messages and commit style](Formula-Cookbook.md#commit) are correct:

1. Ensure the job has already completed successfully.
2. Run `brew pr-publish 12345` where `12345` is the pull request number (or URL).
    - Approving a PR for an existing formula will automatically publish the bottles and close the PR, taking care of this step.
3. Watch the [actions queue](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/actions) to ensure your job finishes. BrewTestBot will usually notify you of failures with a ping as well.

If a pull request needs its commit messages changed in a way that autosquash doesn't support (has the label `automerge-skip`):

1. Ensure the job has already completed successfully.
2. Run `brew pr-pull 12345` where `12345` is the pull request number (or URL).
3. Amend any relevant commits if needed, then run `git push` to push the commits.
