      # The {Sourceforge} strategy identifies versions of software at
      # sourceforge.net by checking a project's RSS feed.
      #
      # SourceForge URLs take a few different formats:
      #
      # * `https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/example/example-1.2.3.tar.gz`
      # * `https://svn.code.sf.net/p/example/code/trunk`
      # * `:pserver:anonymous:@example.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/example`
      #
      # The RSS feed for a project contains the most recent release archives
      # and while this is fine for most projects, this approach has some
      # shortcomings. Some project releases involve so many files that the one
      # we're interested in isn't present in the feed content. Some projects
      # contain additional software and the archive we're interested in is
      # pushed out of the feed (especially if it hasn't been updated recently).
      #
      # Usually we address this situation by adding a `livecheck` block to
      # the formula that checks the page for the relevant directory in the
      # project instead. In this situation, it's necessary to use
      # `strategy :page_match` to prevent the {Sourceforge} stratgy from
      # being used.
      #
      # The default regex matches within `url` attributes in the RSS feed
      # and identifies versions within directory names or filenames.
