# on 2020-12-17 14:47:59 UTC using RuboCop version 0.87.1.
# The point is for the user to remove these configuration records
# one by one as the offenses are removed from the code base.
# Note that changes in the inspected code, or installation of new
# versions of RuboCop, may require this file to be generated again.



# [NOTE] 
# The 100 remaining offeses, relate to the setup of tests using
# swaggerhelper, and VCR cassettes. There is no straightforward
# way to rectify these offenses without restructuring the tests,
# therefore they have been excluded for the timebeing. 

# Offense count: 31
# Configuration parameters: CustomIncludeMethods.
